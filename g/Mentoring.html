	  <li>Grant proposals/collaborations:
	    <ul>
	    <li>Any possible collaborations from EAB meeting on Oct 13?</li>
	    <li>Don't hear back from Prof. Chauchyun Chen on Molecular Dynamic simulation.</li>
	    <li>Will set up a meet with Arvind Ramanathan for the last week of October.</li>
	    <li> Working with <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/people/nico-franz">Prof.Nico Franz <a> on a proposal
	    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
	    This is my idea about grant submission: Nico and Beltram's group use <a href="https://github.com/EulerProject">Euler</a> as a logic-based reasoning model to compare/analyze two input classifications based on some predefined rules by experts. 
	    Dr. Hong Cui focuses more on similarities and differences of biological characteristics of organisms to come up the taxonomic classifications:  
	    <a href="http://taxonconceptexplorer.org/public/images/0/08/ETC-ProjectDescription.pdf"> ETC proposal</a> and 
	    <a href="http://taxonconceptexplorer.org/pub/Main_Page"> ETC site</a>.<br>

		My idea is to extract the hierarchical structures of species from articles, journal papers, and other reliable resources such as <a href="https://www.dataone.org/"> dataOne </a>(using text mining). After having the extracted hierarchies (of course with many conflicting knowledges and ambiguities), we can compare/analyze with existing classifications to try to resolve these ambiguities/conflicting evidences. Visualizations can greatly help with this process.
